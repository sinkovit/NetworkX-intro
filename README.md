# NetworkX-intro
A set of notebooks that provide a brief overview of the capabilities of NetworkX. Developed primarily for the teachers who are using the Discrete Math Pre-Collegiate (DMPC) curriculum.

We recommend working through the notebooks in order, although you can probably skip ahead to topics of interest after completing "01 Working with nodes and edges".
